After disgestion in concentrated sulphuric   distilled into formed anacid, the total organic nitrogen is converted to ammonium sulphate. Ammonia is formed and distillated into boric acid solution under alkaline coditions. The borate anions formed  titrated with standardized hydrochloric acid, by which is calculated the content of notrogen representing the amount of crude protein in the sample.
#### 2. Story

                     3. Standard Sulphuric acid solution 0.002.
                     4. Boric acid and mixed indicator.
12. Arrow 
              Upon navigative mouse pointer over these object the pop up message with the name of  the object will be display.

2.2 Set User Objectives & Goals:
1. Familiar with kjeldahl distillation apparatus and require chemical, distilled mineral water and reagent show on simulater display.
2. Familiarize with glassware using for titration.
3. Addition the sample, distilled mineral water and reagents for distillation process.
4. Connection and start boiling till boric acid flask become 200ml and cool the distillation at room temprature.
5. Calculation of the concentration of ammonia in standard sample and water sample. 
6. Compare and conclude the achived result. 

2.3 Set the Pathway Activities:
1. Display of Kjedahl distillation apparatus, glass ware ( measusuring cylinder ,pipette, pipette blub, conical flask, burette, burette slant, funnel.) Wash bottel, demineralised water, reagents bottles(Boric acid and mixed indicator, borate buffer, standard solution of ammonia, sulphuric acid  0.02N, NaOH of 6N.)
2. Addition of blank, standard water sample in all 3 Kjeldahl distillation flask
3.Dimineralised water measuring addition of cylinder 200ml water  one and all.
4.Addition of 25ml borate buffer in all three flask.
5.Addition of 6N NaOH  upto pH become < 9.5 using pH meter.
6.Addition of 50ml of boric acid and mixed individual 3 flasks.
7.Concentration of Kjeldahl distillation apparatus and boil till boric acid and mixed individual conical flask become 200ml then stop and cool.
8. Titration of all three and note down the reading for calculation.
2.4 Set Challenges and Questions/Complexity/Variations in Questions:

Ques:-1. How many step of Kjeldahl method.
a. Digestion
b. Distillation
c. Ammonia Determination.
d. All of the above.
Ans:-D
Ques:-2. Upon heating ammonium sails wit a base, NH3(g) is given off. nature of this gas is
a. acidic 
b. alkaline 
c. catalyst
d. neutral(pH: 7)
Ans:-B

2.5 Allow pitfalls:
1. Ammonia can directly poison humans and upset the equilibrium of water system.
2.Ammonia is toxic to finish and humans. The toxicity is decreased with lower alkalinity and increased with higher alkalinity as ammonium is converted to ammonia. 
3. Concentration sulphuric acid very dangers of hazards to take very carefully when it is used.
4. NaOH also very dangerous chemical, don't touch and use gloves when doing experiment.
2.6 Conclusion:
The ammonia-nitrogen concentration in the wastewater was determined by using Kjeldhal method.

#### 3. Storyboard
Ammoniacal Nitrogen is a measures for the amount of ammonia, a toxic pollutant  often found in landfill leachate and in waste product, such as sewage, liquid manure QAhealth of water in natural bodies such as rivers or lakes, or man made water reservoirs. The term is used widely in waste treatment and water purification systems.
