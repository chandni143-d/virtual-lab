 
#### 1. Aim and Objective

To determine the concentration of Ammonia Nitrogen in water and waste water sample using Kjeldahl  Distillation Apparatus and titration. Ammonia Nitrogen wastewater ( about 100m/L) was treated by two-stage ozone oxidation method. The effects of ozone flow rate and initial pH on ammonia removal were studied, and the mechanism of ammonia nitrogen removal by ozone oxidation was discussed.
