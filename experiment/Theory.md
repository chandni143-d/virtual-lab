Standard  Deviation is a statistical measure of the precision for a series of repeated measurements. The advantage of of using s to quote uncertainty in a result is that it has the same unit as the experiment data.
         Standard Deviation is calculated from-
                          S=√((∑_(i=1)^N▒(X_i-X ̅ ) )/N)
       Where      N=no. of measurement
                        Xi=each individual measurement
                        X ̅ =mean of all measurements
 The quantity (x-X ̅)  is called the “residual” or “deviation from the mean” for each measurement. The quantity (N) is called the “degree of freedom” for the measurement.
     Relative Standard Deviation-
     The relative standard deviation is useful for comparing the uncertainty between different measurements. The relative standard deviation is calculated from the standard deviation S an
                   RSD={S/X ̅ }×1000ppt
              %-RSD=(S/X ̅ )×100%
The %- RDS is also called the “coefficient of variance” or  CV.        
3. Procedure
1. Work out the mean (the simple average of the numbers)
2. Then for each number: subtract the mean  and square the result.
3. Then work out the mean of those squared difference.
4. Take the square root of that and we are done.
