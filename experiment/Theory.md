#### 2. Theory

1.	Principle/Scope
1.1.	This procedure describes the determination of Ammoniacal Nitrogen in treated water, effluent waste, wastewater, sewages, etc. The sample is buffer d at pH 9.5 with Borate Buffer to decrease hydrolysis of cyanates and organic Nitrogen compounds. It is distilled in to a solution of Boric acid and titrates with standardized H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>.

4.	Sample Quantity
4.1.	Select sample quantity based on the expected level of ammonia nitrogen depending on the nature of the sample.
4.2.	For clear water use 1000 mL sample volume, as they may contain <0.1 mg/L NH3N concentration.
4.3.	The treated water mostly contains less 5-10 mg/L NH3N.
4.4.	In Raw water use less sample volume. (Table .1)
4.5.	Select the volume of the sample based on the following table
5.	Procedure 

5.1.	Measure the required quantity of sample volume according to Table .1
5.2.	Check free chlorine by titrating with 0.025N sodium thio-sulphate (SOP- CHEM-025OMN), if residual chlorine is present, remove it by using de chlorinating agent and if necessary, neutralize to approximately pH 7 with 0.1N HCl (3.8)or 0.1NNaOH(3.9) using a pH meter.
5.3.	Transfer the sample to a distillation flask.
5.4.	Add distilled water to make up the volume 200-250mL.
5.5.	Add 25ml borate buffer (3.4), and adjust the pH to 9.5 by with6N NaOH (3.7)using a pH meter.
5.6.	Add glass beads or boiling chips and use this mixture for distillation.
5.7.	Clean the apparatus before starting the test by distilling with deionized water to remove any impurities.
5.8.	Use distilled water instead of sample to check the Blank.
5.9.	Take 50mL of indicating boric acid solution (3.4) in a 500mL conical flask for collecting distillate.
5.10.	Connect the distillation apparatus, Turn on the condenser cooling water and heater.
5.11.	Collect a distillate of minimum 200mL to indicating boric acid solution (3.4).
