4. Simulation Interactions

This simulation estimation and  plots  the sampling distribution of various statistics. You specify the population, sample size and statistics. An animated sample from the population is shown and the statistics is plotted. This can be repeated to estimate the sampling distribution. CONCEPTS: sampling distribution, standard deviation, standard error,  central limit theorem, mean, median, efficiency, fluctuation, skew, normal distribution.
